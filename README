What changed over the last 3 revisions

=over

=item 0.04	Tuesday 22nd March, 2005	

	Filesys::Virtual plain has its own dist now, so needs a
	seperate line in the Build.PL
	Deleted the reference to rt.cpan.org as I don't want to use it anymore.


=item 0.03   Monday 26th July, 2004

	Depend on Net::DAAP::Client 0.4 so we can extend the SONG_ATTRIBUTES


=item 0.02	Tuesday 18th May, 2004

	docubug - it's Net::DAV::Server not Net::Server::DAV (doh)
	Threw in some more gurards against invalid file paths.
	Removed a stealth dependency on YAML.
